    <p>Last Updated: July 27, 2025</p>
    
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>FreedomFi GPT ("we," "our," or "us") respects your privacy and is committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our GPT application.</p>
    
    <h2>Information Collection</h2>
    <p>Our GPT may collect the following types of information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Financial data you voluntarily provide, such as debt amounts, interest rates, income, expenses, and savings goals</li>
        <li>Calculation preferences and financial strategy choices</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Use of Information</h2>
    <p>The information collected is used solely for:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Performing requested financial calculations</li>
        <li>Providing personalized financial guidance</li>
        <li>Improving the functionality and user experience of the GPT</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not store your financial data beyond the current chat session. All calculations are performed in real-time and are not retained after the session ends.</p>
    
    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not share, sell, rent, or trade your information with third parties. Your financial data remains within the conversation between you and the GPT.</p>
    
    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>While we implement reasonable measures to protect your information, please be aware that no method of transmission over the internet is 100% secure. We rely on OpenAI's security infrastructure for processing conversations.</p>
    
    <h2>User Rights</h2>
    <p>You maintain control over the information you share with our GPT. You can choose not to provide certain information, though this may limit the GPT's ability to provide accurate financial guidance.</p>
    
    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy periodically. We will notify users of any changes by updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy.</p>
